## About
SaferRoad is inspired by the massive number of deaths occurring as a result of road accidents across the country.

Deaths from reckless driving are the third leading cause of death in Nigeria. 

The project "SaferRoad" will help reduce road accidents across the country and can also be used by other developing countries that death causes from road accident are massive in numbers.
